\section{Method}
The datasets originate from a study on the mechanism behind head direction sense \cite{projectdata}.
Five adult male and two female mice were implanted with recording electrodes under anesthesia \cite{projectdata}.
Silicon probes were mounted on movable drives for recording of neural activity in the anteriour thalamus in all mice, while in additional three of the mice probes were also mounted in the post-subiculum (PoS) \cite{projectdata}. The remaning four mice with probes only mounted in the anteriour thalamus, additional probes were mounted in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer for accurate sleep scoring \cite{projectdata}.
The head directions (HD) were tracked using two light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) mounted to the back of the head and recored using a videocamera with a frame rate of 30fps. The data was then resampled to 39Hz by the aquisition system \cite{projectdata}.
Data from two mice were explored, mouse 12 with probes only in the anteriour thalamus and mouse 28 with additional probes in the PoS.  

The electrode spikes can be encoded as timestamps synchronized with the tracked head direction. The timestamps is binned into timebins with a time resolution of 
$$\Delta t = \frac{1}{39Hz} \approx 25.64ms$$ 
corresponding to the sampling frequency of $39$Hz set by the aquisition system.
Each bin corresponds to the number of cell firings over a period of $\Delta t$ time, and each sample has a corresponding head angle.
Dividing by the sampling time yields the number of spikes per unit time in each timebin.

The continious range of possible head directions, 
$\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$
, can be discretized into a desired number of edges $N_{HD}$ with fixed spacing such that
\begin{equation}
\theta_k \in \{\frac{2 \pi k}{N_{HD}}| k \in \mathbb{N}, 0 \leq k \leq N_{HD} \}
\end{equation}
and each tracked head direction sample is binned according to the rule
\begin{equation}
    f_{\theta}(\theta) =  \begin{cases}
        \theta_0, & \text{if } \theta_0 \leq \theta < \theta_{1} \\
        \theta_1, & \text{if } \theta_1 \leq \theta < \theta_{2} \\
         & \vdots \\
        \theta_k, & \text{if } \theta_k \leq \theta < \theta_{k+1}
    \end{cases} \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq k < N_{HD}
\end{equation}
The number of cell firings were binned accordingly to create an overview of number of spikes per head angle.
The firing rate can be found by dividing the number of spikes by the number of head direction samples for each bin.
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_k = \frac{\sum_i S_i}{\sum_i 1} \quad i \in \{t | t \in \mathbb{N}, 0 \leq t \leq N, f_\theta(\theta_t) = \theta_k\}
\end{equation}
where $S_t$ is the number of spikes in timestep $t$, $\theta_t$ is the head angle in timestep $t$ and $N$ is the number of timesteps. Tuning curves are created by plotting the firing rate $\lambda_k$ against the head direction $\theta_k$.

The mutual information score can be approximated using the discrete definition of mutual information
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mutual_info}
    I(X;Y) = \sum_{i, j} Pr(y_i,x_j) \log_2(\frac{Pr(y_i, x_j)}{Pr(y_i)Pr(x_j)}) = \sum_{i,j}Pr(y_i|x_j)Pr(x_j) \log_2(\frac{Pr(y_i | x_j)Pr(x_j)}{Pr(y_i)Pr(x_j)})
\end{equation}
The probability of a cell firing during a short period of time $\Delta t$ while the rat is in bin $k$ can be approximated by
\begin{align} \label{eq:probs}
    Pr(S=1 | X = k) &= \lambda_k \Delta t & Pr(S=1) = \lambda \Delta t = \Delta t \sum_k \lambda_k
\end{align}
where $\lambda_k$ is the mean fire rate in head direction bin $k$ and $\lambda$ is the mean firing rate over all bins.
By inserting \cref{eq:probs} into \cref{eq:mutual_info} it can be shown that the mutal information can be calculated using a discrete approximation \cite{mutualinfo}.
\begin{equation}
    I \approx \sum_k \lambda_k \Delta t \log_2(\frac{\lambda_k}{\lambda})Pr_\theta(k)
\end{equation}
The prior distribution of head angles can be estimated by 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{Pr}_\theta(X = k) = \frac{\sum_i 1}{N}  \quad i \in \{t | t \in \mathbb{N}, 0 \leq t \leq N, f_\theta(\theta_t) = \theta_k\}
\end{equation}
i.e. the proportion of samples corresponding to bin $k$.
