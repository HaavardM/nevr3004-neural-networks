\section{Abstract}
Spike-trains from HD neurons contains information about the head direction for mice. By analyzing the amount of mutual information and tuning properties of different cells, we uncover the relationship between the head direction and the spike patterns for networks of HD cells. We further find a circular relationship between the head direction and the cell activities using principal components analysis to reduce the amount of variables.
