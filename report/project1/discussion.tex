\section{Discussion}
As we can see from \cref{fig:1b_convincing_tuning}, some neurons react strongly to different stimuls. However, each cell only give us a partial clue of what the true head direction is likely to be, and we need to combine multiple tuning curves from multiple cells in order to give a good prediction.
