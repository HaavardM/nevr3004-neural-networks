\section{Introduction}
Sensor fusion is commonly used in robotics and autonomous systems to fuse multiple sources of information (sensors) to create better estimates of a systems state. Any single source may only contains partial information and may only perform well in a few scenarios. However, with enough sources we might still be able to create solid estimates by updating a common belief.  
By considering neurons in the brain as sources of information, the brain may be thought of as a large scale sensor fusion system.

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether it is possible to predict head direction of a mouse by considering the spike-train of different cells in the brain, and see how well a sensor fusion framework may explain how multiple cells can be combined to create one head direction estimate.
