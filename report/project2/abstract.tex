\section{Abstract}
The Hopfield network is an important model for understanding the mechanisms behind associative memory, and is an important basis for many modern methods in artifical neural networks. In this paper we utilize numerical and analytical methods to show how the Hopfield network with a Hebbian learning rule always converges toward a local equilibrium. We will borrow the concept of energy from physics, and investigate the mechanisms of the network using a physical interpretation. We will then use the Hopfield network to restore QR-codes in order to showcase a simple use-case.
