\section{Abstract}
The Hopfield network is an important model for understanding the mechanisms behind associative memory, and is an important basis for many modern methods in artifical neural networks. In this paper we utilize numerical and analytical methods to show how the Hopfield network with a Hebbian learning rule always will converge toward a local equilibrium. By considering each equilibrium as a memory, we showcase the networks ability to recall memories from partial input using both random patterns and QR-codes.
