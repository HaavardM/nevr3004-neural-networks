    \caption{By applying the Hopfield network to a very noisy QR-code we are able to reconstruct the original. By using any QR-code reader we are able to decode the left and right QR-codes, while the middle ones contains too much noise. The same hopfield network was used. The QR-code patterns were stored in addition to a third random pattern. }
